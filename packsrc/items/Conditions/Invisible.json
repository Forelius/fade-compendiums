He suffers no penalty to his AC when attacked by an invisible character. Remember, <strong>someone who attacks loses the bonuses of invisibility</strong>!</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Barlow, sans-serif\">When a creature becomes invisible, all items it carries and wears also become invisible. Any invisible item becomes visible again when it leaves the creature's possession (dropped, set down, etc.). A light source (such as a torch) may be made invisible, but the light given off will remain visible. </span></p>",
