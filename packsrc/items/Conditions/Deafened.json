Since he cannot hear, he will miss many warnings shouted at him by his allies. The deaf character should make a saving throw vs. death ray; if he fails it, he is facing the wrong way when the warning is called. A <em>curse of deafness</em> would be cured by a remove curse spell, while deafness caused by a <em>horn of blasting</em> could be cured by a <em>cureall</em> spell.</p>",
