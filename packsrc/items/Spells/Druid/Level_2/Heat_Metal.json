    "description": "<p>This spell causes one metal object to slowly heat and then cool. It can affect one metal item weighing up to one-half pound (5 cn) per level of the caster. For example, a 12th level caster can heat up to 6 pounds (60 cn), such as a normal sword, while a 20th level caster can heat up to 10 pounds (100 cn), enough to heat a two-handed sword.</p>\n                <p>The heat does not damage magical items but may severely damage normal weapons or items, especially if they contain both wood and metal. If held, the object causes increasing damage each round: 1 point in the first round, 2 in the second, 4 in the third, and 8 in the fourth. The damage then decreases at the same rate over the remaining rounds. In the fourth round, leather, wood, and other flammable materials in contact with the metal catch fire. Total damage over seven rounds is 22 points.</p>\n                <p>The holder gets no saving throw, but fire resistance negates all damage. The holder can drop the item at any time, and creatures of low intelligence are 80% likely to do so each round. The spell disrupts concentration, preventing spellcasting for the duration of damage.</p>\n                <p>Once cast, the spell does not require concentration. Only a <em>dispel magic</em> spell can stop it; normal means, like immersion in water, do not affect it. If cast on an object embedded in a creature (like an arrow or dagger), removing it causes the loss of initiative for that round and inflicts damage for that round as well.</p>",
