This protection also extends to any items carried by the recipient, protecting them against poison effects (e.g., a spirit’s poisonous aura).</p>\n                      <p><strong>Bonus to Saving Throws:</strong> The recipient also gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against poisonous breath weapons, such as a green dragon’s breath. This bonus does not apply to non-poisonous breath effects, like a gorgon’s petrifying breath.</p>",
