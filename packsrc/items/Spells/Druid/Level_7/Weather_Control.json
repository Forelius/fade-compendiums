After 3 turns, the ground becomes muddy, halving movement speed.</li><li>Snow: Visibility is reduced to 20', and movement is halved. Rivers and streams may freeze. Mud persists after thawing.</li><li>Fog: Visibility drops to 20', movement is halved. Creatures within may become lost.</li><li>Clear: Cancels rain, snow, and fog, but does not remove secondary effects (e.g., mud).</li><li>Intense Heat: Movement is halved. Excess water sources (rain, snow, puddles) dry up.</li><li>High Winds: No flying or missile attacks are possible. Movement is halved. Ships sailing with the wind move 50% faster. In deserts, creates a sandstorm (20' visibility, half movement).</li><li>Tornado: Creates a whirlwind under the druid’s control, acting as a 12 HD air elemental. At sea, it functions as a storm or gale.</li></ul>",
