    "description": "<p>This spell grants the recipient immunity to a specified amount of electrical damage. The protection amount depends on the druid's experience level: for each level, one die (1d6) of lightning damage is negated. The protected amount is subtracted from the dice of damage that would otherwise be dealt.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A 20th-level druid protected by this spell negates up to 20d6 lightning damage. This would allow the druid to absorb two full *Call Lightning* attacks (8d6 each), plus half of a third attack (8 + 8 + 4 = 20). Any damage beyond this would be taken as normal, and the recipient still makes any applicable saving throws.</p>",
