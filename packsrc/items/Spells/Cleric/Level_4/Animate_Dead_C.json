    "description": "<p>This spell animates normal skeletons or dead bodies within range, transforming them into enchanted skeletons or zombies. These undead obey the caster until destroyed by a dispel magic spell or another cleric.</p>\n                      <p><strong>Effect:</strong> For each experience level, the caster can animate 1 HD of undead. Skeletons retain the HD of the original creature, while zombies have +1 HD.</p>\n                      <p>Humans and demihumans are treated as 1 HD for this spell. A humanâ€™s corpse would be animated as a 1 HD skeleton or a 2 HD zombie.</p>\n                      <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Animated undead are immune to sleep, charm, and poison effects. Using this spell for good is advised for lawful casters, as animating the dead is often seen as a Chaotic act.</p>",
