    "description": "<p>This is the most powerful healing spell available. When used to cure wounds, it restores nearly all damage, leaving the recipient with only [[/r 1d6 #damage remains]] points of damage remaining.</p><p><strong>Healing Process:</strong> Restore the target to full starting hit points, then roll 1d6 and subtract that amount from their total.</p><p><strong>Alternative Uses:</strong> Instead of healing damage, <em>Cureall</em> may be used to cure <em>one</em> of the following conditions:</p><ul><li>Remove a curse</li><li>Neutralize poison</li><li>Cure paralysis</li><li>Cure disease</li><li>Cure blindness</li><li>Remove a <em>Feeblemind</em> effect</li></ul><p>If the recipient is suffering from multiple afflictions (such as wounds and a curse), the cleric must specify which one the spell is curing.</p><p><strong>Effect on Recently Raised Creatures:</strong> If cast on someone who has just been affected by <em>Raise Dead</em>, <em>Cureall</em> eliminates the need for two weeks of bed rest, allowing the target to function normally immediately. This is the only magical healing that works on a newly raised creature.</p>",
