    "description": "<p>By casting this spell, the cleric gains the ability to navigate toward a specific place, even if they have never been there before. For the duration of the spell, the cleric instinctively knows the direction to their destination.</p>\n                      <p><strong>Special Knowledge:</strong> In addition to knowing the correct path, the cleric gains magical awareness of any special knowledge needed to reach the location. This may include:</p>\n                      <ul>\n                        <li>The location of secret doors</li>\n                        <li>Hidden or obscured passages</li>\n                        <li>Passwords required to gain entry</li>\n                      </ul>\n                      <p><strong>Duration Effects:</strong> When the spell ends, the cleric retains only a general sense of the direction to the destination; all other special knowledge is forgotten.</p>\n                      <p><strong>Restriction:</strong> If the cleric attempts to record or disclose the special knowledge to others in any way, the spell is instantly negated.</p>\n                      <p>This spell is often used to find fast escape routes or to navigate unknown terrain.</p>",
