    "description": "<p>This spell allows the cleric to animate non-living, non-magical objects, causing them to move and attack. Magical objects are unaffected.</p><p>The spell can animate either:</p><ul><li>One object up to 400 lbs (4,000 cn), roughly the size of two men.</li><li>Multiple smaller objects, as long as their total weight does not exceed 400 lbs.</li></ul><p><strong>Combat Abilities:</strong> The DM determines the movement rate, number of attacks, damage, and armor class of animated objects. As a guideline:</p><ul><li>A man-sized statue might move at 30' per round, attack once per round for [[/r 2d8 #points of damage]] damage, and have AC 1.</li><li>A chair might move at 180' per round, attack twice per round for [[/r 1d4 #points of damage]] damage per attack, and have AC 6.</li></ul><p>All animated objects use the clericâ€™s chance to hit in combat.</p>",
