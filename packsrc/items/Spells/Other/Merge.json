    "description": "<p>The effect is quite unusual. The user can permit others to merge their forms with the user's, including all equipment carried, as if all were gaseous. A maximum of seven other creatures can <em>merge</em> with the user. The merging cannot be forced; the user can, at will, prevent anyone from merging. A creature merged with the user can leave the merger by merely stepping out. No creature merged with another (including the user) can attack or cast a spell, but may speak. Damage to the user does not affect those <em>merged</em>.</p><p><span style=\"font-family: Barlow, sans-serif\">It lasts for 7-12 turns (1d6+6), with the exact duration known only to the DM.</span></p>",
