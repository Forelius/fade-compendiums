    "description": "<p>The magical effect protects the user from all bugs, including arachnids (spiders, ticks, scorpions), insects (ants, beetles, flies), and chilopods (centipedes, millipedes). Normal-sized bugs cannot touch the user, and giant-sized bugs will ignore the user unless they successfully make a saving throw against spells. If the giant bug fails its saving throw, it completely disregards the user's presence. Additionally, the effect provides a +4 bonus to any saving throws against magically summoned or controlled bugs.</p><p>It lasts for 7-12 turns (1d6+6), with the exact duration known only to the DM.</p>",
