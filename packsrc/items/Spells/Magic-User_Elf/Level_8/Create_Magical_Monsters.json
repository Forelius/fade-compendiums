    "description": "<p>This spell functions like the <em>Create Normal Monsters</em> spell but allows the creation of monsters with up to two asterisks (special abilities). The range and duration are doubled compared to the lesser spell.</p><h4>Monster Creation</h4><ul><li>The caster chooses the type of monsters created.</li><li>Creatures appear out of thin air and vanish at the end of the duration.</li><li>The total number of Hit Dice created equals the level of the caster (fractions are dropped).</li><li>Undead can be created, but humans and demihumans cannot.</li><li>Monsters with 1-1 Hit Dice count as 1 HD, while creatures with 1/2 HD or less count as 1/2 HD.</li></ul><h4>Construct Creation</h4><p>This spell can also create a construct (see Chapter 14) if the caster provides the necessary materials. Only one construct will appear, but it is permanent and does not vanish when the duration ends.</p><h4>Construct Rules</h4><ul><li>The construct may have a maximum of two special abilities (two asterisks).</li><li>The cost of materials is at least 5,000 gold pieces per asterisk, though the DM may require more.</li><li>The construct can be dispelled under normal rules unless enchanted as a nondispellable construct (see Chapter 16).</li></ul>",
