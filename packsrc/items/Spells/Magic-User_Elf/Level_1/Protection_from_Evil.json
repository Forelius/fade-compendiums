    "description": "<p>This spell creates an invisible magical barrier around the caster, extending less than an inch away from their body. It grants a +1 bonus to all saving throws and imposes a -1 penalty to attack rolls made against the caster. The spell also protects the caster from attacks by enchanted creatures in melee combat.</p>\n                <p><strong>Enchanted Creatures:</strong> Creatures that cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons, creatures that can only be hit by magical weapons, or creatures that are magically summoned or controlled (such as a charmed creature). This does not include creatures that require silver weapons, like werewolves.</p>\n                <p>Enchanted creatures are unable to touch the caster with melee attacks but can still use missile weapons (at a -1 penalty to attack rolls). The barrier does not affect <em>magic missile</em> spells. If the caster attacks any creature in melee, the spell still provides the attack roll penalty and saving throw bonus but no longer prevents contact by enchanted creatures.</p>",
