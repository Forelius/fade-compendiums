    "description": "<p>This spell prepares a secondary spell to be automatically cast when a specified condition is met. The spell stored must be a 4th level or lower magic-user spell that does not cause damage.</p><h4>Contingency Mechanics:</h4><ul><li>The caster defines a specific situation (the trigger) and the spell that will be cast when the situation occurs.</li><li>Once the condition is met, the stored spell takes effect immediately as if the caster had just cast it.</li><li>The contingency applies only to events occurring within 120' of the triggering event.</li><li>No creature or item may have more than one contingency active at a time.</li><li>A <em>wish</em> cannot override this restriction.</li><li>The contingency remains indefinitely until triggered.</li></ul><h4>Example Contingencies:</h4><ul><li><em>\"If I am struck by a living creature that is not a Lawful or Neutral cleric, except for my allies Charlie McGonigle and Sally Silvernose, then cast Charm Monster on the attacker.\"</em></li><li><em>\"If I fall below 8 HP and am about to take damage, then cast Dimension Door on myself to a location I have seen in the last 12 hours.\"</em></li></ul><h4>Duration:</h4><ul><li>The contingency lasts indefinitely until the event occurs.</li><li>It may remain dormant for centuries if the situation never arises.</li></ul>",
