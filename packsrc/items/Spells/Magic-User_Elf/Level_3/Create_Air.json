    "description": "<p>This spell provides breathable air in a volume of 8,000 cubic feet (such as a 20' x 20' x 20' room) for 1 hour per caster level.</p>\n                      <p><strong>Stationary Use:</strong> Typically cast in enclosed spaces, it remains in one area, providing air for all within.</p>\n                      <p><strong>Mobile Use:</strong> The spell can be cast on enclosed vehicles, living creatures, or items to travel with them, including underwater or in airless environments. For example, a pegasus-rider could cast it on themselves and their mount to travel into outer space. Stealthy movement underwater is impossible due to visible air bubbles.</p>\n                      <p>The spell does not protect against poison gases unless the gas is a natural atmospheric component.</p>",
