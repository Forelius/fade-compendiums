    "description": "<p>This spell removes existing spell effects within a 20' x 20' x 20' area. Spell effects cast by a spellcaster of equal or lower level are automatically dispelled.</p>\n                      <p><strong>Higher-Level Casters:</strong> Effects created by a higher-level spellcaster may resist dispelling. The chance of failure is 5% per level difference. For example, a 7th-level magic-user dispelling a spell cast by a 9th-level cleric has a 10% chance of failure.</p>\n                      <p><strong>Magical Items:</strong> This spell does not affect magical items themselves, but it can disrupt active effects they produce. For instance, dispel magic can free a person from the control of a ring of human control.</p>",
