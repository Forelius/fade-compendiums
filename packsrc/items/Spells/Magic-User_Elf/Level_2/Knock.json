    "description": "<p>This spell unlocks any type of lock, including normal and magically locked doors (such as those affected by <em>hold portal</em> or <em>wizard lock</em>). It can also open secret doors, but the door must be located first. The spell does not permanently remove locking magic, which will re-engage once the door is closed again.</p>\n                  <p><em>Knock</em> can unstick a gate, cause a barred door to open (forcing the bar to fall), and make treasure chests open easily. However, if a door is both locked and barred, only one of the locks will be affected.</p>\n                  <p><strong>Note:</strong> If the lock is affected by a spell, the target can make a saving throw vs. spells to resist.</p>",
