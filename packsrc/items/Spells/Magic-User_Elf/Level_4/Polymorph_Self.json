    "description": "<p>This spell allows the caster to take on the physical form of another living creature, provided the new formâ€™s Hit Dice are equal to or less than the caster's. If this condition is not met, the spell fails.</p>\n                      <p><strong>Physical Abilities:</strong> The caster retains their own AC, hit points, attack rolls, and saving throws, and does not gain special abilities (like a ghoul's paralysis) or immunities of the new form. However, they gain the physical capabilities of the form. For example, a caster polymorphed into a frost giant would gain giant strength and the ability to throw boulders, but not cold immunity. A dragon form would allow flight but not breath attacks or spellcasting.</p>\n                      <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> The caster cannot cast spells while polymorphed. The spell lasts for 6 turns + 1 turn per caster level, until dispelled, or until the caster is killed. This spell cannot be used to assume the form of a specific individual.</p>",
