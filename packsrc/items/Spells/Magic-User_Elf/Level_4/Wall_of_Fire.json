The wall is opaque and blocks sight, and it cannot be created in a space already occupied by another object.</p>\n                      <p><strong>Duration:</strong> The wall remains as long as the caster concentrates on it without moving.</p>\n                      <p><strong>Breaking Through:</strong> Creatures with less than 4 Hit Dice cannot pass through the wall. Creatures with 4 HD or more may pass through, taking 1d6 fire damage in the process. Undead and cold-using creatures (e.g., white dragons, frost giants) each take double damage (2d6) when breaking through.</p>",
