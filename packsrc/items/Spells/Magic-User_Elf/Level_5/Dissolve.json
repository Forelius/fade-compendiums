The caster can shape the area within these limits (e.g., 20' x 150', 30' x 100').</p><p><strong>Movement Effects:</strong> Creatures moving through the mud are slowed to 10% of their normal speed and may become stuck. A saving throw vs. spells may be required to avoid being stuck, at the DM's discretion.</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> The effect lasts for 3-18 days [[/r 3d6 #days]].</p>",
