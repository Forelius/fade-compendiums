    "description": "<p>This spell allows the caster to move a creature or object by sheer concentration. The weight of the object can be up to 200 cn (20 lbs) per caster level. For example, a 10th-level caster could move an object up to 2,000 cn (200 lbs).</p>\n                      <p>The object can be moved in any direction at a rate of up to 20' per round. The caster must concentrate, and the movement stops if concentration is broken.</p>\n                      <p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> An unwilling creature may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid being moved. If an item is being held, the holder may make a saving throw with a -2 penalty. For items carried but not held, the owner may attempt to grab it with a saving throw at a -5 penalty.</p>",
