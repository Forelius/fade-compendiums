A successful skill roll is required to perform any acrobatic feat; failure may result in the character falling. A successful roll allows the character to reduce the effective height of a fall by 10 feet. This skill also grants a +2 bonus on saves vs. mechanical traps where agility would help, such as tilting floors and pit traps.</p>",
