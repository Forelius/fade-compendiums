    "description": "<p>This skill enables a character to command the crew of a piece of artillery, such as a catapult or trebuchet. While knowledge of the skill suffices for general operation, a skill check is required each time the artillery is aimed at a new target. This skill also allows the character to make precise calculations regarding trajectory, distance, and throw weight. It can be taken multiple times to learn both operation and construction of siege weapons. If an artillery device is improperly operated or built without a character possessing this skill, it is more prone to malfunction or failure.</p>",
