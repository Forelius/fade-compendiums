    "description": "<p>Healing allows the treatment of wounds and diagnosis of illnesses among humans and demihumans. A successful skill roll can restore 1d3 hit points to a wounded character. This skill can only be used once per set of wounds, defined as all hit points lost in a single combat. A natural roll of 20 accidentally inflicts [[/r 1d3 #Healing hit points restored]] damage, and the healer may not attempt to treat those wounds again. Success with a roll of 5 or more indicates the healer can determine if an illness is natural or magically induced.</p>",
