    "description": "<p>By taking directions from the position of the sun and the stars (or other atmospheric phenomena appropriate in your campaign), the character can always know roughly where they are. Successful skill rolls, with positive or negative modifiers for the character's distance from their home territory and familiarity with their surroundings, will tell the character more precisely where they are. This skill can prevent parties from getting lost and may help them reorient when disoriented in unknown regions. The DM may require a check every day to keep the party on course.</p>",
