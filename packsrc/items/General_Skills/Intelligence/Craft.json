    "description": "<p>The Craft skill represents proficiency in a particular trade or profession, such as armor-making, bow-making, leatherworking, or weapon-smithing. The player must specify the type of craft the character knows when this skill is chosen. A successful roll allows the character to produce high-quality goods, make expert opinions, and even identify the craftsmanship of other items within the chosen craft. Multiple types of Craft skills can be taken, with each representing a different trade. This skill is essential for characters wishing to create or repair equipment and items within their area of expertise.</p>",
