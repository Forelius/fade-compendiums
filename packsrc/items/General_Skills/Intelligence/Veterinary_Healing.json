A successful skill roll allows the character to restore [[/r 1d3 #Veterinary Healing (Hit Points Restored)]] hit points to a creature. This skill can be taken in two ways:</p><ul><li><strong>General Veterinary Healing</strong>: A +1 penalty applies for each type of creature the character treats.</li><li><strong>Specialized Veterinary Healing</strong>: Pertains to one specific class of creatures (e.g., equines), with no penalty for that class but a +2 penalty for all others.</li></ul><p>A character with this skill who attempts to treat humans or demihumans must roll with a +3 penalty.</p>",
