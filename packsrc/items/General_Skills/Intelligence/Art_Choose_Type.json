A successful skill check allows the character to create works that can improve NPC reactions. For example, presenting a well-crafted portrait or sculpture to an NPC may provide a +2 bonus to reaction rolls. If preferred, the player can choose to base this skill on Wisdom instead of Intelligence.</p>",
