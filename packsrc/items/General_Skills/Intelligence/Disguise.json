    "description": "<p>The Disguise skill allows a character to alter their appearance convincingly to impersonate someone else. This requires a successful skill roll for each individual or group the character attempts to deceive. Targets of the disguise must make a Wisdom check against the character's Disguise roll to see through the impersonation. This skill is invaluable for covert operations, espionage, and any situation where a character must appear as someone else. A failure may result in the disguise being detected, exposing the character to potential danger or hostility.</p>",
