For each additional type of animal the character wishes to train, they must take this skill again. For example, horse training and dog training are separate skills, but a horse trainer can handle any horse or pony, and a dog trainer can train any breed of dog. This skill is commonly found in cultures with a strong bond to a specific animal type.</p>",
