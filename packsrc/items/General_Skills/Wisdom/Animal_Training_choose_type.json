    "description": "<p>This skill allows the character to raise, train, and care for one specific type of animal. The animal can be taught simple tricks or basic commands. For each additional type of animal the character wishes to train, they must take this skill again. For example, horse training and dog training are separate skills, but a horse trainer can handle any horse or pony, and a dog trainer can train any breed of dog. This skill is commonly found in cultures with a strong bond to a specific animal type.</p>",
