A character with 18 strength can draw the string back single-handedly, allowing them to fire each round. Characters with less strength must place the crossbow on the ground, brace it with a foot, and use both hands to pull the string back, limiting them to firing every two rounds.</p><p>This crossbow requires both hands, so the wielder cannot use a shield and always loses individual initiative to opponents using one-handed weapons. Small creatures, such as halflings and goblins, cannot use this weapon.</p>",
