    "description": "<p>This weapon consists of a long, braided leather strap with a handle, ranging in length from 5 to 30 feet. It is a hand-to-hand weapon capable of causing damage (1d2 points) or entangling opponents. Before each combat round, the wielder must declare whether they are attempting to deal damage or entangle. In either case, a normal attack roll is required.</p><p>If the attack hits, the whip either deals 1d2 points of damage or, if attempting to entangle, forces the target to make a saving throw vs. death ray, potentially with a bonus. The saving throw bonus and the outcome of the entangling attempt are determined using the Weapon Special Effects Table. On a failed saving throw, the target suffers one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><strong>Entangle</strong>: The victim is unable to attack, cast spells, or move until they succeed on a saving throw.</li><li><strong>Slow</strong>: The victim's movement and attack rates are halved, and they cannot cast spells.</li><li><strong>Delay</strong>: The victim automatically loses initiative in the next round.</li></ul><p>This weapon is primarily a tactical tool and is often used by thieves or other characters who prefer to support front-line fighters without directly engaging in melee combat.</p><p>A whip can only entangle creatures with a solid form; it has no entangling effect on wraiths, spectres, ethereal creatures, or monsters composed of water (e.g., water elementals). However, these beings still take normal damage from the whip. (Note that a regular whip cannot harm creatures that require magical weapons to hit; such cases require a magical whip.)</p>",
