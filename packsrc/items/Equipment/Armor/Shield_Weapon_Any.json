It serves a dual purpose, offering standard defensive capabilities while allowing an additional attack during combat when paired with a one-handed weapon. These weapons, typically used by fighters, thieves, and demihumans, come in various sizes, with larger versions requiring two hands. While versatile, shield weapons are prone to breaking under specific conditions, such as precise attack rolls, adding an element of risk to their use.</p>",
