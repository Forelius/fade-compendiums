There is no limit to the range, as long as both scrolls are on the same plane of existence. The message may be up to 100 words in length. If one message is erased, the other disappears as well. Each message must be erased before another can be written, and there is a 5% chance (not cumulative) that any erasing will destroy the magic of both scrolls.</p>",
