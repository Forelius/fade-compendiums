    "description": "<p>Each map should be made in advance by the GM. Such maps show a route to the location of a treasure in a dungeon or a wilderness area. The treasure is usually hidden or protected by monsters, traps, and/or magic. Based on the type of treasure given, the GM should select a challenging monster (who has a similar treasure type) and design the map and monster lair accordingly. Note that the map may be partially incorrect, omitting an important detail (such as the type of monsters, dangerous traps, etc.) or giving some false information; however, the treasure mentioned should actually be there. Sometimes maps are only partially complete or are written in the form of a riddle. And some can only be read by a <em>read languages</em> spell.</p><p><em>Normal treasure</em> contains coins and gems but no magical items, while a <em>magical treasure</em> may include some coins and a few gems of low value in addition to magical items. A <em>combined treasure</em> has coins, magical items, and valuable gems or jewelry in roughly equal proportions. <em>Special treasure</em> should contain at least one permanent magical item, such as a staff or sword; these items should be mentioned on the map.</p>",
