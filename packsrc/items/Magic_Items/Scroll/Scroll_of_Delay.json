    "description": "<p>This is a scroll of a single spell. When casting the spell from the scroll, the user states a delay from 0 to 12 rounds. If the user keeps the scroll on their person, they have complete control of the spell when it occurs. If the scroll is not carried by the user, the spell effect appears around the scroll itself, affecting the nearest creature if the spell requires a recipient. <em>The scroll is not harmed by its own effect, even for fire-type spells.</em> For example, an elf reads a delay lightning bolt scroll, delays it 8 rounds, and then puts the scroll away. Eight rounds later, when the <em>lightning bolt</em> appears, the elf may choose range and direction by concentration, as if casting the spell then.</p>",
