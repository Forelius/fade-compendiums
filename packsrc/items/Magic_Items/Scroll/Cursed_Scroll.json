    "description": "<p>Unfortunately, when any writing on a cursed scroll is even seen, the victim is immediately cursed. No reading is necessary. The GM must make up each scroll's curse. Examples of a few common curses include the following:</p><ul><li><p>The reader turns into a frog (or some other harmless animal).</p></li><li><p>A wandering monster of the same level as the reader appears and attacks the reader by surprise (a free attack with bonuses).</p></li><li><p>One magical item owned by the reader disappears (the item is chosen or randomly determined by the GM).</p></li><li><p>The reader loses one level of experience, as if struck by a wight. (The GM should roll again for a first-level character to avoid unfair \"instant death.\")</p></li><li><p>The reader's Prime Requisite must be re-rolled.</p></li><li><p>Future wounds will take twice as long to heal, and healing spells will only restore half normal amounts until the curse is lifted.</p></li></ul><p>Only a <em>remove curse</em> spell can remove a curse of this nature. However, the GM may allow the cursed character to be cured by a high-level NPC cleric or magic-user, who will demand that the character complete a special adventure or perform a worthy but difficult task.</p>",
