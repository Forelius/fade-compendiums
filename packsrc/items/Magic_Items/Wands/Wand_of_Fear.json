    "description": "<p>This wand generates a cone of fear that extends 60 feet long and 30 feet wide at its far end. Anyone caught within the cone must make a saving throw against wands or flee from the user at three times their normal speed for 30 rounds.</p><p>This wand is crafted from dark, polished wood, featuring a sleek and slightly curved design. At the end, it is adorned with a menacing skull motif, intricately carved and detailed, giving it a foreboding presence. The skull's eye sockets glow faintly with an eerie light, while the shaft of the wand is etched with subtle, arcane symbols.</p>",
