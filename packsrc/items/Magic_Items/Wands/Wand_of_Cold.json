All within the cone take 6d6 points of cold damage, but they may make a saving throw vs. wands for half damage.</p><p>This dark, polished wand feels heavy in your hand, its surface etched with frost-like patterns. The tip is capped with a translucent blue crystal that resembles ice, and a faint mist occasionally emanates from it, hinting at the chilling power within.</p>",
