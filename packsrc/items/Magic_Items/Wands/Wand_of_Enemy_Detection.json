Moving, taking damage, or failing a Saving Throw results in the concentration breaking and the effect ending.</em></p><p>This wand is crafted from dark, smooth wood, featuring a slightly twisted design. At the tip, a striking gem shaped like an eyeball glows with a fiery red hue, while faint, glowing runes spiral along its length.</p>",
