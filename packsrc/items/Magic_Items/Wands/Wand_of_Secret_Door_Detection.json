    "description": "<p>The user may find any secret door within 20', using one charge per secret door found.</p><p><em>The effect will remain as long as the caster concentrates. Moving, taking damage, or failing a Saving Throw results in the concentration breaking and the effect ending.</em></p><p>This elegantly crafted wand is made from a shimmering silver wood, adorned with intricate carvings of ancient symbols. Its tip glows faintly with a soft, ethereal light, pulsating gently as if alive. When held, the wand seems to hum with a subtle energy, guiding its wielder with an intuitive warmth. A delicate crystal embedded in the handle refracts light in mesmerizing patterns, hinting at its hidden abilities.</p>",
