Its surface shows faint runes and hairline veins; one end tapers to a rounded tip while the other terminates in a small carved motif. It feels surprisingly light and balanced.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This creates a lightning bolt (as if using the magic-user spell), starting up to 240' away and 60' long from that point. The victims take 6d6 points of electrical damage, but they may make a saving throw vs. wands for half damage.</p><p>A slender, polished rod of dark wood, its surface etched with intricate silvery-blue lines that seem to crackle with barely contained energy, ending in a slightly tapered tip that gleams with an almost metallic sheen.</p>",
