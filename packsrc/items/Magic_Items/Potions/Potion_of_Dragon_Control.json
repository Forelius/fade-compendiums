Large and huge dragons are not affected. The controlled dragons will obey commands except for casting spells. They will become hostile when the control ends.</p><p>Roll [[/r 1d20 #See dragon control results table]] to determine the dragon type affected:</p><p>1–5: White (or Crystal)<br>6–10: Black (or Onyx)<br>11–14: Green (or Jade)<br>15–17: Blue (or Sapphire)<br>18–19: Red (or Ruby)<br>20: Gold (or Amber)</p><p>The GM can roll 1d100; on 01–30 the effect targets the gemstone variant (e.g., crystal instead of white, onyx instead of black, etc.).</p><p>It lasts for 7-12 turns (1d6+6), with the exact duration known only to the DM.</p>",
