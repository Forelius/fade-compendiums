    "description": "<p>If an Avenger has a Wisdom score of 13 or higher, they can cast cleric spells as if they were a cleric of one-third their level (rounding down). For example, a 12th–14th level Avenger casts spells as a 4th-level cleric. If the Avenger’s Wisdom is 12 or lower, they cannot cast spells but can still be an Avenger.</p><p>To gain this ability, the Avenger must learn meditation and spellcasting from clerics of their order. This training comes at a cost determined by the DM, with a suggested minimum of 10,000 gp per cleric spell level gained.</p>",
