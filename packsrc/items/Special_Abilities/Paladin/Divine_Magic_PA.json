    "description": "<p>If a Paladin has a Wisdom score of 13 or higher, they can cast cleric spells as if they were a cleric of one-third their level, rounding down. For example, a 9th-level Paladin casts spells as a 3rd-level cleric, while a 17th-level Paladin casts as a 5th-level cleric.</p><p>If the Paladin’s Wisdom is 12 or lower, they cannot cast spells but can still be a Paladin.</p><p>The Paladin learns meditation and spellcasting from clerics of their order. The clerics refuse any payment or compensation for this training.</p>",
