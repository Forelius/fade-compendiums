    "description": "<p>This maneuver allows a character to perform a powerful hand-to-hand attack. When using this option, the character automatically loses initiative and takes a -5 penalty to their attack roll (but still applies their Strength and magic bonuses).</p><p>If the attack hits, the character adds their Strength bonus, magic bonuses, and their full Strength score to the weapon's normal damage.</p><p>For example, a character with a Strength of 17 (+2 to attack and damage) using a sword +2 (+2 to attack, 1d8 + 2 damage) would execute the attack as follows: the attack roll is made with a net penalty of -1 (+2 +2 -5). If successful, they roll 1d8 + 21 (17 + 2 + 2) for damage!</p>",
