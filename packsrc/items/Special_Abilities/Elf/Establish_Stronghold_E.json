    "description": "<p data-start=\"26\" data-end=\"496\">At Name Level (9th level), an Elf may construct a stronghold deep in the wilderness. Unlike the castles of human lords, an Elven stronghold is designed to blend harmoniously with its natural surroundings. Common locations include the tops of massive trees, the edges of secluded valleys, or behind waterfalls. The effort required to beautify the structure makes its cost equivalent to a human-built stone castle​.</p><h3 data-start=\"498\" data-end=\"533\">Clan Support and Settlers</h3><p data-start=\"534\" data-end=\"1017\">When an Elf builds a stronghold, their Clan will assist in finding a suitable location. If the Elf does not have enough gold, the Clan will provide an interest-free loan of up to 50% of the cost. Additionally, if the Clan's existing stronghold is smaller, they may relocate entirely to the new site. Otherwise, they will still offer resources and settlers, with up to 40% of the Clan moving to support the new domain​.</p><p data-start=\"1019\" data-end=\"1377\">If the stronghold is threatened by enemies, the entire Clan may rally in its defense. In extreme cases, multiple allied Clans may join forces to protect the settlement. Many monsters hesitate to engage in direct warfare against an organized Elven Clan stronghold due to their magical and martial prowess​.</p><h3 data-start=\"1379\" data-end=\"1415\">Friendship with the Forest</h3><p data-start=\"1416\" data-end=\"1641\">Once the stronghold is completed, the Elf develops a mystical bond with the local wildlife. All normal animals within five miles of the stronghold become friendly toward the Elf and their kin. These animals can:</p><ul data-start=\"1642\" data-end=\"1739\"><li data-start=\"1642\" data-end=\"1679\">Warn of approaching strangers</li><li data-start=\"1680\" data-end=\"1708\">Carry news of events</li><li data-start=\"1709\" data-end=\"1739\">Deliver short messages</li></ul><p data-start=\"1741\" data-end=\"1949\">In return, the animals expect protection and aid from the Elves, fostering a symbiotic relationship between the stronghold and the surrounding wilderness​.</p>",
