    "description": "<p>Upon reaching Name Level (9th level, 660,000 XP), a Dwarf is recognized as a Dwarf Lord (or Dwarf Lady for female characters) and may establish a stronghold. This stronghold is typically an underground cavern complex built in mountainous or hilly terrain, in keeping with dwarven tradition.</p><p data-start=\"348\" data-end=\"598\">If the Dwarf has forsaken their Clan and lives among humans, they may construct a sturdy stone fortress in human style. However, even in such cases, the Dwarf will still prefer to have an underground complex connected to their dwelling.</p><h3 data-start=\"600\" data-end=\"638\">Stronghold Forces & Defenses</h3><ul data-start=\"639\" data-end=\"1019\"><li data-start=\"639\" data-end=\"717\">The Dwarf may hire only dwarven mercenaries for their military forces.</li><li data-start=\"718\" data-end=\"852\">Specialists and hirelings of other races may still be employed, such as human engineers, elven scouts, or halfling messengers.</li><li data-start=\"853\" data-end=\"1019\">The stronghold is expected to be heavily fortified, often featuring stone walls, hidden tunnels, reinforced gates, and mechanical traps to repel invaders.</li></ul><p data-start=\"1021\" data-end=\"1207\" data-is-last-node=\"\">This stronghold serves as the Dwarfâ€™s seat of power, a center of trade, craftsmanship, and military strength, often attracting fellow dwarves seeking refuge or work within its halls.</p>",
