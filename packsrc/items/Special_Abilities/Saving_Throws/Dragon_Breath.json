    "description": "<p>The saving throw against Breath Weapons is used to resist or mitigate the effects of a wide range of powerful exhaled attacks, not limited to dragons. This includes attacks like a dragon’s fiery or icy breath, a gorgon's petrifying breath, or a chimera's elemental breath. Each creature’s breath weapon has specific effects, such as damage, paralysis, or petrification. A successful saving throw generally halves the damage or avoids the secondary effect (such as paralysis or petrification), while failure applies the full consequences. The target number for the saving throw is determined by the character’s class and level.</p>",
