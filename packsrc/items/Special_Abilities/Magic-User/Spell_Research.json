    "description": "<p>A character can attempt to create a new spell, provided it is of a level they can cast. The process requires:</p><ul><li><p>1,000 gp per spell level</p></li><li><p>Two weeks of research per spell level</p></li><li><p>Rare components, often necessitating an adventure to obtain</p></li><li><p>A fully stocked laboratory or library</p></li></ul><p>The chance of success depends on the character's Intelligence score and level, with modifications for spell difficulty. If a research attempt fails, the process must be restarted, but each failure grants a +5% cumulative bonus to future attempts.</p><p>Typically, a character does not have a sufficient library for advanced research until reaching 18th level, or at least 9th level if they have collected extensive magical tomes. While research is technically possible at any level, lower-level characters may struggle to meet the requirements.</p>",
